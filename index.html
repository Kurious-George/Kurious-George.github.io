											<h2>Who am I?</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Hi I'm George! A former Mill Valley Middle School student and a recent Villanova School of Engineering graduate with a passion for teaching others. I grew up in Marin County and am now a resident once again! As an accomplished student myself I understand the difficulties students face and what learning techniques they can use to succeed. I have taken all levels of both middle and high school maths and sciences and have stayed familiar with them through my years in college.</p>

											<h2>Tutoring Services</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I offer personalized tutoring for middle and high school students in math, computer science, and science subjects. With a strong background in these areas, I work one-on-one with students to help them understand challenging concepts, improve their problem-solving skills, and build confidence in their coursework. Tutoring sessions are tailored to each studentâ€™s needs and pace, whether they need help keeping up in class or want to get ahead. I offer flexible scheduling and can meet in person or online, depending on what works best for the student.</p>

											<h2>How and Why I Tutor</h2>
										</header>
										<p>I believe that every student has the potential to succeed, and my role as a tutor is to help them unlock that potential. I use a variety of teaching methods and resources to engage students and make learning enjoyable. My approach is student-centered, meaning I focus on the individual needs and goals of each student. I also emphasize the importance of building a strong foundation in the subject matter, as this is crucial for long-term success.</p>
